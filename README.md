# Inheritance and Polymorphism
### This was created during my time as a [Code Chrysalis](https://codechrysalis.io) Student

You have been brought in as a consultant to clean up messy code. A CAD software shop has a module that calculates the areas of various shapes. Over the years, they've gotten complicated and added many more shapes.

Unfortunately, the original switch-case pattern has been extended, using your knowledge of polymorphism, refactor this code to:

* Eliminate the conditionals
* Identify the common behavior amongst all shapes
* Formalize that behavior in a super class
* Create sub classes that extend the behavior of the super class but add implementations specific to their needs

If you get stuck, watch [Sandi Metz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bZh5LMaSmE) explain the Gilded Rose.
